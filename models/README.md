## SIREN
Neural network architecture with periodic activation functions. For more details check out the [SIREN README](models/SIREN/README.md).

## Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of neural networks designed to solve differential equations by incorporating physical laws directly into the learning process. Unlike traditional neural networks that learn purely from data, PINNs include the governing physical equations as part of their loss function, ensuring that the network's predictions adhere to fundamental physical principles.
