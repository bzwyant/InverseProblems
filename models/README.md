# Models

## [SIREN](SIREN/README.md)

Neural network architecture with periodic activation functions.

## [WIRE](WIRE/README.md)

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/924aa7ab-45f4-44da-9c71-0afbe0887986)

A multilater perceptron (MLP) architecture for implicit neural representations with the complex gabor Wavelet as the activation function.

## [Conv-INR](README.md)

ConvINR was proposed as an alternative to using multilayer perceptrons with sinusoidal activations in the paper [Conv-INR: Convolutional Implicit Neural Representation for Multimodal Visual Signals
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04249)
