## SIREN
Neural network architecture with periodic activation functions. For more details check out the [SIREN README](models/SIREN/README.md).

## WIRE



## Convolutional Net INR

ConvINR was proposed as an alternative to using multilayer perceptrons with sinusoidal activations in the paper [Conv-INR: Convolutional Implicit Neural Representation for Multimodal Visual Signals
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04249)
