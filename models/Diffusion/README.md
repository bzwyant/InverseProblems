## Introduction

### What is a diffusion model

In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models or score-based generative models, are a class of latent variable generative models. A diffusion model consists of three major components: the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling procedure. The goal of diffusion models is to learn a diffusion process for a given dataset, such that the process can generate new elements that are distributed similarly as the original dataset. A diffusion model models data as generated by a diffusion process, whereby a new datum performs a random walk with drift through the space of all possible data. A trained diffusion model can be sampled in many ways, with different efficiency and quality.
