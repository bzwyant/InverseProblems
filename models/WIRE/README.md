Inspired by harmonic analysis, WIRE is a highly accurate and robust INR that does not exhibit the tradeoff between high accuracy and poor robustness (to signal noise, parameter variation, etc.). Wavelet Implicit neural REpresentation (WIRE) uses as its activation function the complex Gabor wavelet that is well-known to be optimally concentrated in space-frequency and to have excellent biases for representing images.
